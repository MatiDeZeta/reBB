                <p>I created reBB with a simple goal: to provide a free, open-source tool that makes creating formatted content easy for everyone. This project has been a labor of love, and it will <strong>always remain free and open-source</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>For the longest time, I've been covering the server costs myself. While it's not a huge expense (about â‚¬5 per month), any contribution would mean a lot and help ensure the service stays online and continues to improve.</p>
